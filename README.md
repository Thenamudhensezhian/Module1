Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

🧠 Algorithm
Get an input from the user.
Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
If true, print "EVEN".
Else, print "ODD".
End the program.
🧾 Program
~~~
a=int(input())
if(a%2==0):
    print("EVEN")
else:
    print("ODD")
~~~
Output

Result
Thus,the Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements is created successfully.

Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

🧠 Algorithm
Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
Print the value of a with the label "a is".
Print the value of b with the label "b is".
Print the value of c with the label "c:".
Print the value of d with the label "d:".
💻 Program
~~~
a=(0==True)
b=(False==False)
c=True+True
d=False+9
print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")
print(f"c: {c}")
print(f"d: {d}")
~~~
Output
<img width="819" height="498" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2304494-edec-4da2-9d72-a4f484d4de70" />

Result
Thus, to write a python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False is compiled and the output is verified successfully.

Datatypes-Character Literal in Python
🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.

🧠 Algorithm
Print the character 'T'.
Print the character 'a'.
🧾 Program
~~~
char1='T'
char2='a'
print(char1)
print(char2)
~~~
Output
<img width="1175" height="458" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e10a12b-86bc-4899-a51d-34e87afd8f08" />

Result
Therefore to write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals is compiled and the output is verified successfully.

🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

🧠 Algorithm
Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
Print the complex number x.
Print the real part of x using x.real.
Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.
💻 Program
~~~
a=int(input()) 

b=int(input()) 

x=complex(a,b) 

print(x) 

print(x.real) 

print(x.imag)
~~~
Output
<img width="763" height="442" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad09816f-1b60-451f-9ace-a152fe4d1d9f" />

Result
Thus the prgram has been successfully executed.

# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## 🧾 Program
~~~
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()

print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
~~~
## Output
<img width="1044" height="297" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2473b490-fcc2-4459-a8a8-ce86cf42d639" />

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully execute.
